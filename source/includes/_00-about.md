# Introduction
_"When you wish to instruct, be brief" - Cicero_

This is a summary of the knowledge I have gathered along my career and I think is essential to get started making games and content with PixiJS.

[PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/) is an HTML5 Creation Engine and can be used to create beautiful digital content with the fastest, most flexible 2D WebGL renderer.

We could spend pages and pages discussing what PixiJS is and isn't, or if you should or shouldn't use it over other engines, frameworks, or libraries **but I refuse to do so**. I assume that if you are here is because you already made your mind so I won't try to convince you.

Let's get straight to teaching!
